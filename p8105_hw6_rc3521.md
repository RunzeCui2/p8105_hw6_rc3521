## Problem 2

We imported the data firstly

``` r
homicide = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

Now, we create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a
binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Besides, we
omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO; and Tulsa, AL.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  homicide %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
   mutate(
     city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
     resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
     reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date), format = "%Y%m%d"),
     victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
     victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")
    ) %>%
  filter(city_state != c("Tulsa, AL","Dallas, TX","Phoenix, AZ","Kansas City, MO"),
         victim_race == c("White","Black")) %>%
  relocate(city_state)
```
